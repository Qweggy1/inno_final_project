<h1>About Qweggy</h1>
    <p>I HATE TALKING ABOUT MYSELF but here we are. So my name is Qweggy also known by that frog on the internet.

        <p>I have been known as Qweggy for my entire internet life apart from a few significantly earlier names but I was very enclosed or should we say lived under a rock, only spoke to those I spent my whole school life with until a certain game was released in 2020 called Fuser, know this wasn't a massive announcement, not a huge amount of people to this day still don't know what Fuser is but they is a small army of us, who live for Fuser. Fuser is a DJ mixing game that takes 30 seconds snippets from many songs and splits them into 4 categories or stems we call them in the music world, these being Drum, Bass, Lead, and Vocals fuser allows you to take any of these stems and mix them with other song stems and voila your mixing music from well-known artists.</p>

        <p>Fuser was where it all began for me, iv always loved music and this was a cherry on the cake. I started mixing and got known within fuser for the heavy custom basses I created, they were one very particular song this was called Daniel Wiggy the lyrics of this song is a frog ribbiting and saying Daniel ( that's all ) however when this song is pitched can you guess what the lyric says? No... it says "Qweggy" boom That frog from the internet was born! and here I am today. A lover of everything FROG
        From this that frog that stays under his rock constantly was out a lot more within a Discord community of 400 people and every one of them knows me as That frog, the moment this is mentioned by name is always mentioned straight after, and of course, I was kinged to be the best at bass in fuser and friend request started flooding in. From 1 - 2 maybe 4 friends I know have 400+ all of which I talk to, about many aspects within life but 90% of the time it involves music talk.</p>

        <p>A lot of you would be saying, OKAY so yes you have said it came from a GAME! but you make music with a DAW you also DJ this isn't a game this is an industry right? and I say to all of you correct. So how did I come about being a DJ or even a Music Producer?! well within many conversations DJ'in and Music production always came up and I always got told I should be doing it, so after many many failed attempts I got my head down and started with the decks, getting my head around everything, learning the basics, moving on to transitions for many months and one day it clicked! I was DJ'ing not even realising I was! it seemed too easy, too straightforward, but it was coming to me like walking.</p>
